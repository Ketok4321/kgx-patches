# GNOME Console patches
Some patches for GNOME Console that I wrote

## List of patches
- `container-mode` - makes the window titlebar turn blue when inside a distrobox/toolbox container
- `no-root-warning` - disables the dialog that warns the user about pasting a command that contains 'sudo'

## TODO
- Customizable shortcuts
